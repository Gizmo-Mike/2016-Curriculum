This directory contains the complete assembly and coding instructions used for Gizmo Garden 2016, as a PowerPoint Show (Gizmo Garden Instructions.ppsx). It can be viewed with either PowerPoint or the free PowerPointViewer application. You must also have QuickTime installed for the embedded videos to play. You can find PowerPointViewer and QuckTime for your computer by searching the Web. Note that these applications come free from Microsoft and Apple, and require you to accept their licence agreements. Gizmo Garden LLC is not responsbile for any problems with or consequences of installing or attempting to install them.

The file is very large, about 480MB. It is stored on GitHub using the Large File Storage (LFS) system. To download it, click on the file link in the Instructions directory, and then click the Raw button. The normal options for downloading and saving the file should appear. At least that's what happened in Internet Explorer on my Windows 7 machine.

The directory also contains a PDF version of the slide show. However, the PDF does not preserve the videos that are in the PPSX. These videos are short clips of me doing many of the steps in the gizmo assembly. In our program, each student had a very inexpensive PC running the Arduino application and the PowerPoint show, so that they could see right in front of them what to do, and watch at their own pace. In the PDF, the video clips are replaced by a static image of the first frame of the video.
